PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Learning the very basics of Java classes
VERSION or DATE: 2021-08
AUTHORS: Patrick GIRARD

SUBJECT 
Write a very simple robot class: the robot has a name, 
it evolves in a 2D world made of squares, and manages 
its position in this world (xPosition and yPosition, integer values). 

At this step, we consider that the world is infinite. 
We do not need any constructor yet.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
- The first thing to do is to create a Robot class...
- Pick your name attributes in the subject
- Design simple things: no extra, no useless items, direct naming
- Meet Java writing rules â€¢ Make sure your attributes are protected (encapsulation)
- You can use the AutomatedEvaluation BlueJ extension
to assess your structural design and java writing alla long the development
- Don't forget using BlueJ to test the functional requirements.
- Never modify the Scenario.TXT file

SKILLS
- Skill 1: Designing a class 
- Skill 2: Implementing encapsulation
- Skill 3: Writing code that meets standard coding guidelines
